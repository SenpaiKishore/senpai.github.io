### Official Work experience:
**Lukwood Kitchen (2021-2023):**
- I was the interior designer, but also managed some operations and marketing aswell.
- Used ArredoCAD and AutoCAD to craft client designs.
- I also oversaw material procurement and inventory management time to time.
- I also developed custom CRM software using Python & SQL for project management.
- Also developed a CAD-to-cutlist program in C++ which nested all the CAD parts into the fixed sizes of wooden board, which also took inventory management into account for efficient scarp(waste) management.
